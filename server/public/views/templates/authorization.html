      <H2>Service Authorization</H2>

      <p>I, {{ac.serviceObject.name}}, hereby authorize C.A.R.S. to perform the following services and repairs on the vehicle
            listed below:</p>
      <p>{{ac.serviceObject.service_requested}}</p>
      <br><br><br><br><br>

      <p>I understand that the service(s) will be performed by volunteers who are not professional automotive technicians. Should
            I encounter any problems with the service(s) performed by C.A.R.S. I will immediately cease driving the car and
            contact C.A.R.S. I also agree that I will promptly return the car for examination if I am requested to do so.
            I understand that I am solely responsible for the safe driving condition of my vehicle at all times. I agree
            that C.A.R.S. will not be responsible for the failure or breakdown of any components that were not serviced by
            C.A.R.S. or it's volunteers and that C.A.R.S. and it's volunteers assume no responsibility or liability for the
            failure or breakdown of any installed part. All part warranties shall be the responsibility of the seller and/or
            manufacturer of the part if such a warranty exists. I waive any and all claims, demands, or lawsuits for myself,
            my assignees, and my estate against C.A.R.S., it's volunteers, and/or agents which may arise from vehicle inspection
            or service performed by the C.A.R.S. Ministry.</p>
